		<p> Name: Marianne C. Monroy </p>
		<p> Nickname: Mars </p>
		<p> Favorite CMSC subject so far: 
		I think it's CMSC 11. Those were the times when programming isn't really complicated, and it taught me the things that became my foundation in programming. </p>
		<p> Favorite GE so far:
		 NASC 7. I just love animals, and I enjoyed how the course was taught, not as usual as the other classes. </p>
		<p> Favorite PL:
		Python. It is the first PL that I've learned and it's the first  language that I loved. First loves really are something. </p>
		<p> Favorite Food: 
		There are a lot of them. I love donuts, coffee, and chicken meals. </p>
		<p> Hobbies:
		Drawing, painting, playing ukulele, and singing </p>
		<p> Childhood dream:
		When I was a child, I wanted to be a fashion designer (lol), maybe because my mother used to put beads in gowns so she had a lot of gown catalogues. I enjoyed drawing and sketching gowns back then. But that dream doesn't exist anymore. I realized I just really love to sketch and dresses are just my favorite to sketch back then. </p>
